OMG, just finished watching The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep, and seriously, that was a wild ride. Like, they just throw you into the madness right from the get-go and don't even bother to slow down. Geralt’s there being all stoic and badass, and I'm sitting here wondering how he manages to brood so much without pulling a muscle. 

I mean, come on, those sirens were creepy as heck! The way they lured those sailors in—classic monster shenanigans, right? But of course, Geralt's all like, “not today, sea demons.” And then the trident fight! Who even thinks of these things? It’s like someone said, “Geralt vs. Poseidon” and just rolled with it. Who writes this stuff? 

> Did I mention the maps? There was so much map stuff. Like, I get it, fantasy world, need to know where everything is, but sheesh, just once I’d like for them to go somewhere without needing to decipher an ancient scroll first. And Ciri! She was like, “I got powers, watch out!” while being chased around by everything that wanted a piece of her. Protect that girl at all costs, seriously.

Random thought though, why is Yen always in the mood for causing drama and casting spells at the most inconvenient times? Like, girl, I love you, but not every solution involves pyrotechnics, you know what I mean? But then again, when you can shoot fire from your hands, I guess why not, right?

Oh, and when they got back to Kaer Morhen—SO nostalgic! The whole “let’s go back to our roots” vibe had me feeling all warm inside. Except for that one scene where they decided to have a heart-to-heart while the place was burning down, like timing, people, come on!

download the movie if you haven't yet, but make sure you’re prepared for a rollercoaster. I won't lie, I think I need a nap after all those plot twists. And it doesn’t help that every episode ends on a cliffhanger. Like, do they want me to sleep or just stay up and watch the movie until sunrise? Malicious! 😂

Anyway, I didn’t even know what I was getting into but there’s something super fun about diving back into that world, getting all caught up in the chaos. It’s like junk food for the brain, you know? Just a lot of action, drama, and some occasional sarcasm—like witchers are now apparently running sarcasm workshops or something. Imagine a bunch of kids leaving scoff comments everywhere. 🎭
